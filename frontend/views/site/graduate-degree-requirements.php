                <p>The MA and MS degree programs provide an introduction to scholarly activities and research and often serve as preparation for teaching careers. These degrees are awarded for the completion of a coherent program designed to assure the mastery of specified knowledge and skills, rather than a random accumulation of a certain number of courses. The overall form and content of the student’s program of study is the responsibility of the faculty of the department or program. To carry out this responsibility, each student must be assigned a major adviser, who, in consultation with the student, plans a program of study and research in accord with school and departmental guidelines.</p>
                <p>At least 60 ECTS at the graduate level must be completed with at least an average grade of B (3.00). No course numbered below 600 may be applied toward graduate degree requirements.</p>

Minors represent significant coursework completed in an area related to the student’s specialty. Such areas of concentration or minors are added to the transcript upon the granting of the degree.</p>
                <p>Master’s degrees are conferred only on those students who have completed all courses required for the degree with at least a 3.00 GPA.</p>
